# Pusle_and_Saturation_logger_arduino

<p> Thesis project where bracelet to measure pulse and saturation was created. The bracelet consists of MAX30102 pulse and saturation sensor as well as ESP32 microcontroller. Sensor readings gets send from MAX30102 to the ESP32, where pulse and saturation values are calculated and stored in micrcontroller SRAM memory. When user wants to read the measured values they can connect to the mobile application using bluetooth.</p>
